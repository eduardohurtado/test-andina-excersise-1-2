## Install the project

Run `npm install` to download all the app dependencies.

## App requirements

You need to have installed [Node Js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your system to run the local online development server.

## Online Development server

Run `npm run build` to build the project, and then run `npm run devn` to start a dev local node server. Navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). The app will load the source files from the webpack build command.

## Offline development server

Run `npm run dev` for a webpack dev local server. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files, but this mode is only for layout React changes.

## Run test

Run `npm test` to execute all the functional and render test configured for the App, if you want to leave the test executer in "watch mode", just run `npm run testw` and all the tests will run automatically when you change any of the source files.
